  <p> “Tick Tock”, where time dances with childhood dreams. Here, memories of laughter and play <br>
    intertwine with the passage of time, creating a canvas painted with nostalgia. As kids, time was <br> 
    like a slinky, twisting and turning with each new adventure. Our toys were more than objects— <br> 
    they were gateways to magical worlds, fueled by imagination and wonder.
    
    <br> <br> This website is a tribute to those cherished moments, with graphics inspired by the playful<br>
     motion of a slinky. Here, time is not just seconds ticking by, but the joy of discovery and the <br> thrill of exploration.
    
    After all, as the poem my mother sang to me reminds us, "twinkle twinkle <br> 
    little stars, up above where we are," time may pass, but the memories we hold dear will <br> 
    always shine bright in the constellation of our hearts.</p>
