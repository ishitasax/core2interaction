  Hey hey,
<br> <br> 
As I sit down to write this letter, I can't help but feel a twinge of sadness deep within my heart. It's the feeling of missing something, or rather, someone – family.

<br> <br>  
I know how it feels to yearn for the comfort and familiarity of loved ones nearby. To long for the warmth of a hug, the sound of familiar voices, and the joy of shared moments together.


 <br> <br>  
 It's during times like these that I find myself reminiscing about all the cherished memories we've shared – the laughter around the dinner table, the late-night conversations, and the simple moments of togetherness that made life feel whole.

 
 <br> <br> 
 But even though physical distance may separate us, please know that you are never far from my thoughts and my heart. Our bond transcends miles and time zones, and no amount of distance can diminish the love and connection we share as family.

 
 <br> <br> 
 Until the day comes when we can be reunited once again, I hold onto the memories we've created and the hope of future gatherings filled with love, laughter, and joy.

 
 <br> <br> 
 In the meantime, please take care of yourself and know that you are loved more than words can express.


<br> <br> 
With all my love,

<br>
Ish
