// const text = `Dear Friend,

// <br>
// <br>

// I know what it's like to feel lonely. That sense of emptiness, like there's a void <br> 
// inside you that nothing seems to fill. It can be overwhelming at times, making you <br> 
// feel like you're the only one in the world who feels this way.
// <br> 
// <br>
// But I want you to know something important: You are not alone.
// <br>
// <br> 
// Even though it might feel like it right now, there are countless others out there who <br>
// understand what you're going through. People who have felt the same isolation, the <br> same
// ache in their hearts. You are part of a vast community of human beings who <br> have experienced
// loneliness in one form or another.
// <br>
// <br> 
// And while it might not offer immediate comfort, know that this feeling won't last forever. <br>
// It's temporary, like a passing storm cloud in the vast sky of your life. There are brighter <br> 
// days ahead, filled with warmth and connection.
// <br>
// <br>
// In the meantime, I encourage you to reach out. Whether it's to a friend, a family member, <br> or 
// even a stranger online, don't be afraid to share how you're feeling. You'd be surprised <br> 
// how many people are willing to lend an ear or offer a kind word of support.
// <br>
// <br>
// And if you're not ready to talk to someone just yet, that's okay too. Sometimes, simply <br> 
// reading words of encouragement can provide a sense of solace. That's why I'm here, writing <br>
// this letter to you. To remind you that you are valued, you are worthy, and you are not alone.

// <br>
// <br>

// Take care of yourself, dear friend. And remember, brighter days are on the horizon.

// <br>
// <br>

// With love and lots of hugs,
// <br> Ish
