    <h1> Quick and Easy Brownies </h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <b> 2 cups white sugar: </b> These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar. </li>
        <li> <b> 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour: </b> All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter. </li>
        <li> <b> 1 cup butter, melted: </b> Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness. </li>
        <li> <b> 4 eggs: </b> Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together. </li>
        <li> <b> ½ cup cocoa powder: </b> Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies! </li>
        <li> <b> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract: </b>  Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies. </li>
        <li> <b> ½ teaspoon baking powder: </b> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise. </li>
        <li> <b> ½ teaspoon salt: </b>  A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. </li>
        <li> <b> ½ cup walnut halves: </b>  Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Directions </h2>
   <ul> 
    <li> <em> Step 1: </em> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan. </li>
